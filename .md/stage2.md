stage2.md

At this stage we will develop a Django project according to the database architecture from the tech_spec.md and implement it using frontend templates.

We can use the structure from tech_spec.md or develop a more robust and technically correct if needed, though in the file there are all the detailed entities and funcs, etc, that e need in the project.

Steps of implementation.
1. Create a Django project
    1. Initialize a new Django project.
    2. Connect PostgreSQL as a database using the settings from the env file.
    3. Create a structure of Django applications to organize the project logic. For example, a separate application for movies, a separate application for users and reviews.
    4. Configure configuration files (for example, settings.py) to connect the database, work with migrations, static files and templates.
2. Develop models and migrations
    1. Implement models based on the project scheme developed in the first stage:
        1. Models: movies, reviews, ratings, users.
        2. Relationships between models described in step ‘Create a Django project’:
    2. Implement database migrations to create tables and their relationships.
    3. Apply migrations by creating the necessary tables in the database.
3. Connecting templates and developing the frontend:
    1. Connect templates for rendering pages using Django Templates.
    2. Configure Bootstrap for styling the interface (or wireframes, depending on preferences).
    3. Implement basic pages with templates:
        1. Home page with a movie catalog.
        2. Pages for viewing a list of movies (catalog).
        3. Pages for viewing detailed information about a movie.
    4. Implement navigation between pages. For example, links to individual movie categories, transition to detailed information about a movie.
4. Implementation of basic functionality
    1. Implement basic functionality for movies:
        1. Displaying a list of movies on the home page and in the catalog.
        2. The ability to go to detailed movie pages.
        3. Displaying brief information about a movie: title, description, rating.
    2. Configure filtering by genre, release date, and other parameters.
5. Django Admin Panel
    1. Configure Django Admin to work with the main models: managing movies, users, and reviews through the standard admin panel.
    2. Implement the ability to add new movies, edit, and delete content through the admin panel.
6. Testing functionality
    1. Test page display and correct filter operation.
    2. Check the connection to the database and the correct operation of requests for adding and displaying data.
    3. Make sure that the templates and site navigation work correctly.


After completing this step, the following should be ready:
1. The main structure of the Django project.
2. Implemented models and connections to the database.
3. Configured templates for page rendering and a basic frontend.
4. Basic functionality of the movie catalog.
5. Configured and working admin panel for content management.

Testing at every stage. At every stage of development, unit and integration tests must be written and run. Use tools to check code coverage with tests (for example, pytest-cov) to control the quality of testing.

Documentation of stages. Each stage of development should be described in the project documentation section. It is important to indicate what tasks were performed at this stage, what changes were made and what problems were solved - Let’s create a special .md for that where we will describe everything accordingly.

CI/CD. During the integration and deployment process, each pull request should automatically run tests via CI/CD. This will ensure that the code is checked before merging and that all changes work correctly. After successful testing, the changes can be automatically deployed to the staging server for testing in production.

Documentation in the repository. The root of the repository should contain a README.md file, which contains a description of the project, instructions, and a description of the project and for installation, launch, testing, as well as a description of the code structure. It is also recommended to maintain a CHANGELOG.md file to record all changes as the project develops (let me know if you think this is needed or not).
