Goals and stages

Weâ€™ll create online platform for rating movies, similar to Kinopoisk.ru or IMDb.com. With the growing amount of content on the web, an important step is to create a platform that will allow users to rate movies, leave reviews and comments, and participate in discussions.
The main goals of the platform:
1.  to provide convenient tools for users to interact with content and with each other, as well as the ability to filter and sort content.
2. to create a scalable platform with the ability to further expand, for example, adding recommendations for users based on their preferences or integrating an API for automatically updating movie data.
3. modern and technically correct project, fully documented, etc.

We could create a separate technical specification .md to describe the steps we should take to complete the project. For example, we could devide the work in four steps:
1. First Stage (stage1.md): Database architecture and development.
    1. Building the project architecture based on the MVC model.
    2. Defining the main models: movies, users, reviews, ratings.
    3. Creating a database in PostgreSQL and setting up relationships between models (e.g. OneToMany, ManyToMany).
    4. Setting up migrations and creating fixtures to populate the database with test data.
    5. Testing the functionality of the data model
2. Second Stage (stage2.md): Django project and templates.
    1. Developing the main project on Django, setting up applications.
    2. Connecting templates for rendering pages (Django Templates + Bootstrap).
    3. Implementing catalog pages, movie detail pages, and a review form.
    4. Developing content filtering and sorting functionality.
    5. Setting up Django Admin to manage movies, users, and reviews.
3. Third Stage (stage3.md): Testing and Deployment.
    1. Writing unit and integration tests to check the main components of the project.
    2. Setting up CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.
    3. Setting up Docker and Docker Compose to containerize the project.
    4. Setting up Nginx to handle requests and ensure security (optional).
    5. Deploying the application to the server with a fully configured environment (PostgreSQL, Nginx, Django).
4. Fourth Stage (stage4.md): API refinement and development.
    1. Refining the project.
    2. Implementing a REST API using Django Rest Framework
    3. Setting up authentication via JWT or other means.
    4. Adding additional features, such as filtering data via API, sorting, and working with reviews.
    5. Developing and testing APIs for mobile or external applications.
    6. Testing the API and integrating it with the main project.
