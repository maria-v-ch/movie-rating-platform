Testing and QA:
1. Unit tests. Each major component of the application should be covered by unit tests. This includes tests for user authentication and registration, adding reviews, filtering and sorting content, and working with the database. Use the unittest or pytest framework to write tests.
2. Security tests. You should write tests to check the security of the application. This includes testing protection against XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, and other common attacks. Make sure that input validation works correctly and that protection against abuse, such as spam, works at the review and registration level.
3. Integration tests. Write integration tests to check how the various components of the system interact. These tests should check how the application works as a whole, from user login to filtering and adding reviews. Such tests can be run in a Docker environment to check operability in real-world conditions.
4. UI tests. Use UI testing tools such as Selenium or Cypress to automatically check user actions in the browser. These tests will help ensure that all UI elements work as intended and identify potential navigation and accessibility issues.
5. Load tests. Conduct load tests to ensure that the system can handle a large number of users and operations simultaneously. You can use tools like Locust or JMeter for this. Tests should include scenarios with bulk adding of reviews, filtering and sorting of large amounts of data.
6. Performance testing. Include tests to monitor the performance of the application. This will help identify bottlenecks in the system that may slow down the operation under increased load (for example, filtering on large databases or rendering pages with large amounts of data).
7. CI/CD and test automation. Include testing as part of the CI/CD process so that each commit and pull request automatically runs all tests. This will help to detect errors early in the development process and prevent existing features from breaking.
8. Tests documentation. Be sure to add a description of the tests to the documentation, indicating which scenarios are covered by the tests, how to run them, and how to add new tests in the future.

Testing should be systematic and comprehensive, covering both functional and non-functional aspects of the application, including security, performance, and availability.

Docker, deployment, and sensitive data management:
1. Containerization. The project should be deployed using Docker. All core services (Django application, PostgreSQL database, Nginx for handling requests and statics) should be containerized. Docker Compose is recommended for managing multiple containers simultaneously. Each service should be described in the docker-compose.yml file for easy deployment.
2. Nginx. Use Nginx as a reverse proxy and for handling static files. Nginx should be configured to properly route requests to the Django application, as well as to provide secure HTTPS traffic.
3. Sensitive data management. To store sensitive data, such as API keys or database passwords, use Docker Secrets or .env files with protection. It is important that sensitive data is not committed to the repository.
4. Deployment automation. Add deployment instructions to README.md, including setting up the environment and installing the necessary dependencies. CI/CD integration should automatically deploy the application to the server after successful testing.
5. Deployment instructions. A detailed description of the steps for setting up and running the application, including creating and running containers, should be provided in the documentation.
6. Deployment process. All steps for deploying the project should be clearly described in the documentation (README.md). This should include:
    1. Cloning the repository.
    2. Setting up a .env file with sensitive data (API keys, passwords).
    3. Running database migrations.
    4. Deploying containers via docker-compose.
    5. Setting up SSL and domain names for secure access.
