# Movie Rating Platform - Consolidated Project Specification

## Project Overview
A movie rating platform similar to IMDb/Kinopoisk where users can rate movies, write reviews, and participate in discussions. The platform will be built using Django, with a REST API powered by Django Rest Framework.

## Key Requirements
1. Keep the project simple and focused
2. Complete each stage sequentially to avoid rework
3. Reuse existing deployment infrastructure (paragoni.space)
4. Maintain proper documentation throughout development

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Django + Django Rest Framework
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Django Templates + Bootstrap
- Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose
- Web Server: Nginx
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana

## Project Stages

### Stage 1: Database Architecture
1. Models Design
   - Movies (title, description, release date, genre, etc.)
   - Users (extending Django's User model)
   - Reviews (text, date, user, movie)
   - Ratings (score, user, movie)
   - Categories/Genres (for movie classification)
   - User Favorites (ManyToMany relationship)
   - Moderation flags for reviews

2. Database Setup
   - PostgreSQL configuration
   - Migration system
   - Initial data fixtures

### Stage 2: Django Project Development
1. Project Structure
   - Core application setup
   - User authentication
   - Movie catalog functionality
   - Review and rating system
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Support for multilingual content (optional)
   - Pagination for movie lists and reviews

2. Frontend Implementation
   - Base template with Bootstrap
   - Movie listing and detail pages
   - User profile pages
   - Review and rating forms

### Stage 3: Testing and Deployment
1. Testing
   - Unit tests for models and views
   - Integration tests for key workflows
   - Security testing
   - Performance testing
   - Load testing (using Locust or JMeter)
   - UI testing (using Selenium or Cypress)
   - Test coverage requirements (minimum percentage)

2. Deployment
   - Docker configuration
   - Nginx setup
   - SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt)
   - CI/CD pipeline

### Stage 4: API Development
1. REST API Implementation
   - Movie endpoints (list, detail, create, update, delete)
   - Review endpoints
   - Rating endpoints
   - User authentication (JWT)

2. API Documentation
   - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
   - Usage examples

## User Roles
1. Administrator
   - Full access to admin panel
   - Content management
   - User management

2. Registered Users
   - Write reviews
   - Rate movies
   - Create personal movie lists

3. Anonymous Users
   - View movies and reviews
   - Search and filter content

## Key Features
1. Movie Catalog
   - List and detail views
   - Search functionality
   - Filtering by genre, rating, year

2. User System
   - Registration and authentication
   - Profile management
   - Personal movie lists

3. Review System
   - Text reviews
   - Star ratings
   - Review moderation

4. Admin Interface
   - Content management
   - User management
   - Review moderation

## Deployment Architecture
1. Docker Containers
   - Django application
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Nginx web server
   - Prometheus monitoring
   - Grafana dashboards

2. Domain Configuration
   - SSL certificates
   - Apache reverse proxy
   - Static file serving

## Development Guidelines
1. Code Quality
   - Follow PEP 8 standards
   - Write comprehensive docstrings
   - Maintain consistent code style

2. Testing
   - Write tests before implementing features
   - Maintain high test coverage
   - Include performance tests

3. Documentation
   - Keep README.md updated
   - Document API endpoints
   - Include deployment instructions

## Security Considerations
1. Authentication
   - JWT for API
   - Session-based for web interface

2. Data Protection
   - Input validation
   - XSS prevention
   - CSRF protection

3. Environment Variables
   - Secure credential storage
   - Different configs for dev/prod

## Monitoring and Logging
1. Application Metrics
   - Request timing
   - Error rates
   - User activity

2. System Metrics
   - Server resources
   - Database performance
   - Cache hit rates

## API Endpoints
Key API routes:
- GET /api/movies/ - movie list with filtering
- GET /api/movies/{id}/ - movie details
- POST /api/movies/ - add movie (admin only)
- PUT /api/movies/{id}/ - edit movie (admin only)
- DELETE /api/movies/{id}/ - delete movie (admin only)
- GET /api/reviews/{movie_id}/ - movie reviews
- POST /api/reviews/ - add review (auth required)

## Performance Requirements
1. Caching Strategy
   - Cache popular movies
   - Cache user preferences
   - Use Django Cache Framework or Redis

2. Database Optimization
   - Proper indexing
   - Query optimization
   - Connection pooling

   - User flows working as expected
   - Admin functionality fully operational

2. Code Quality Metrics
   - PEP8 compliance
   - Use of Class-Based Views
   - Proper MVC separation
   - Code coverage percentage

3. User Interface Quality
   - Responsive design
   - Consistent styling
   - Intuitive navigation
   - Cross-browser compatibility

4. Infrastructure Quality
   - Successful containerization
   - CI/CD pipeline functionality
   - Monitoring system effectiveness
